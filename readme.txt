Welcome to David's Rendition of Battleship!
-------------------------------------------

[1.] What's up?

	Well, I've given up. Not completely, that's for sure, but on this project for now.
There's not much more that I can do without too much work, and I dont' want to end up 
breaking it too badly this close to it being due. 

[2.] Now that that's over.

	When you load up the game, you'll notice there are two "fields" with 100...little...
balls? Moving on, you'll notice there are two portraits and little speech bubbles. But,
what are they? Is that a...pony?
	Yes it is! There's an internet phenomenon called "bronies." They are "bros" that are
into My Little Pony (Friendship is Magic.) Anyways, I joined the 'herd,' as it may be and 
decided to go with a unique Battleship theme, and this is where the idea came from. 
	So that explains a little bit, but not enough. Who are the pictures of, what are the
round things, and what's up with the rest of the stuff? Long story short, Discord (upper
right) is a fan of chaos. The parasprites (the little round balls on the playing field)
are bad things. Pinkie Pie (lower left pony) is the player and she's trying to stop 
Discord.
	OK, so the story isn't all there, and it's certainly not explained in the game. That's
what I get for being overambitious.

[3.] Playing

	So you've gotten over the shock factor, congrats. When you first start it up
you get to place your 5 groups of red parasprites. These symbolize your ships.
You place them in descending order of size, sadly there is no way to change order
or rotation of the ships. Once all 5 are placed, the boards are swapped and you
start guessing at Discord's parasprite placements. He doesn't guess back, and
once you discover all of them, there's no message you won, but hey, at least I have
something done!
